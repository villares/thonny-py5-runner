# A py5 plug-in for Thonny

## forget this repo and just go immediatly install @tabreturn's [thonny-py5mode](https://github.com/tabreturn/thonny-py5mode)

#### It allows you to run .py files with the py5 runner tool for "imported mode" & it's much better than my original proof of concept because it installs py5 and the Java 11 runtime you need. Just make sure you have a Python >= 3.8 enabled Thonny IDE.
